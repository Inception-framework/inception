# Inception : System-wide Security Testing of Real-World Embedded Systems Software

Inception is a framework to perform security testing of complete real world firmware programs.
It supports symbolic execution  of firmware source code where high level languages (C/C++) are mixed with hand-written assembly or binary dependencies. It is build on top of Klee.

## Building

There are two ways to install Inception:

* The easiest way is to use our Docker image.
